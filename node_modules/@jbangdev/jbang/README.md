# jbang-npm - Java Script in your JavaScript

Install and use [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev) from npm based projects.

Lets you use your own local scripts, [JBang AppStore](https://jbang.dev/appstore) alias or any network reachable jar or Maven artifact.

## Usage
The `jbang.exec()` function accepts a string that will be passed as the command-line arguments to the `jbang` executable.

Given this script `test.js`:

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node
const jbang = require('@jbangdev/jbang');
jbang.exec('properties@jbangdev');
```

And in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@jbangdev/jbang": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Now you can invoke the `test` script from the command-line:

```
npm run test
```

You can easily [pass command-line arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14404223/143475) around:

```js
let args = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ');
jbang.exec('com.myco.mylib:RELEASE ' + args);
```

So now if you run `npm run test arg1 arg2`, `arg1 arg2` will be appended to the command executed.

## Behind the scenes

When you run `npm install` - JBang and other dependencies will be installed via the [npm `preinstall`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts#npm-install) hook. This uses the [`app setup`](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/installation.html#using-jbang) command.

Opening a new terminal or shell may be required to be able to use the `jbang` command from the system `PATH`.

## Using as a dependency

In most cases you should be able to use JBang directly in node scripts.

But if you want to provide more customization you can create your own "wrapper" NPM package. One of the advantages is that you can pre-install the library dependencies needed at the time of `npm install` (just by calling `--help` or a similar "no op" command) so that the user-experience when running the first command after install is better.

For an example, refer to the [`@karatelabs/karate`](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate-npm) NPM package.
